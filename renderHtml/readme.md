This is developed as a simple fun program.  
The html files are created by keeing <b>automation exercise</b> in mind.
The <b>Go-lang</b> program was developed, so that I feel a hosted site.


### For users without Go-lang:

For those who wish to use this site/program but do not have a go-lang compiler, I built [renderInWindows.exe](https://github.com/0x218/Go/blob/master/renderHtml/renderInWindows.exe) for Windows-64 bit.  
```
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o renderInWindows.exe main.go
```
